/**
 * This bolt performs rolling counts of incoming objects, i.e. sliding window based counting.
 * <p/>
 * The bolt is configured by two parameters, the length of the sliding window in seconds (which influences the output
 * data of the bolt, i.e. how it will count objects) and the emit frequency in seconds (which influences how often the
 * bolt will output the latest window counts). For instance, if the window length is set to an equivalent of five
 * minutes and the emit frequency to one minute, then the bolt will output the latest five-minute sliding window every
 * minute.
 * <p/>
 * The bolt emits a rolling count tuple per object, consisting of the object itself, its latest rolling count, and the
 * actual duration of the sliding window. The latter is included in case the expected sliding window length (as
 * configured by the user) is different from the actual length, e.g. due to high system load. Note that the actual
 * window length is tracked and calculated for the window, and not individually for each object within a window.
 * <p/>
 * Note: During the startup phase you will usually observe that the bolt warns you about the actual sliding window
 * length being smaller than the expected length. This behavior is expected and is caused by the way the sliding window
 * counts are initially "loaded up". You can safely ignore this warning during startup (e.g. you will see this warning
 * during the first ~ five minutes of startup time if the window length is set to five minutes).
